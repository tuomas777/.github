# 🚀 Reusable CI workflow for Node

This reusable workflow is part of the City of Helsinki’s GitHub Actions setup, specifically designed to provide an opinionated and consistent CI process for City of Helsinki’s Node projects.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Commit Linting**: Enforces commit message standards using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).
- **Build and Lint**: Build and verifies code style and formatting via yarn.
- **Automated Testing**: Runs project tests via yarn.
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Performs a [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) scan.

## 📋 Requirements for Projects Using the Workflow

- **commitlint** [config file](https://commitlint.js.org/reference/configuration.html#config-via-file) is present in the root of the project.
- **SonarQube Cloud** is configured with `SONAR_TOKEN` set in the repository or organization secrets.

### 🧶 Yarn Commands

- **build** the project.
- **lint** run [eslint](https://eslint.org/) or another lint tool.
- **test:coverage** runs project tests with coverage.

### 🪡 Optional Yarn Commands

- **typecheck** run tsc check
- **check-size** run browser bundle size limits check. The command is run if the `.size-limit.js` file is found in the app directory.
- **check-dist**: run ecmascript checks for build files. The command is run if the `.escheckrc` file is found in the app directory.

## 📚 Usage Instructions

To use this reusable workflow, create a project-specific workflow file in your `.github/workflows` directory. Ensure the `uses` value is set to `City-of-Helsinki/.github/.github/workflows/ci-node.yml@main` and `secrets` is set to `inherit`. Also provide the following inputs as needed:

### 🛑 Required Inputs

- **`node-version`** (string): Specifies the Node version to use in the workflow.

### 🔶 Optional Inputs

- **`extra-commands`** (string): Additional setup commands or checks to execute before running tests. Can be used to set environment variables: `echo "EXTRA_TEST_ENV_VAR=test" >> $GITHUB_ENV`.
- **`typecheck`** (boolean): Run typecheck command. Default is `false`.
- **`working-directory`** (string): Repository working directory where to run yarn installation and the tests. Default is `.` (the repository root).
- **`app-directory`** (string): The subdirectory of the application where the tests are run. Default is **`working-directory`**.
- **`commitlint-config-file`** (string): Path to the commitlint config file. If empty, commitlint uses its default config discovery (file in repository root).

### 🔑 Secrets

- **`SONAR_TOKEN`**: Token for SonarQube Cloud Scan. Required.
